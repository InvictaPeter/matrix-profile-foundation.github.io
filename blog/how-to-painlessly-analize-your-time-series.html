                    We’re surrounded by time series data. From finance to IoT to marketing,
                    many organizations produce thousands of these metrics and
                    mine them to uncover business-critical insights. A Site
                    Reliability Engineer might monitor hundreds of thousands of
                    time series streams from a server farm, in the hopes of
                    detecting anomalous events and preventing catastrophic failure.
                    Alternatively, a brick and mortar retailer might care about
                    identifying patterns of customer foot traffic and leveraging
                    them to guide inventory decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Identifying anomalous events (or “discords”) and repeated
                    patterns (“motifs”) are two fundamental time series tasks.
                    But how does one get started? There are dozens of approaches
                    to both questions, each with unique positives and drawbacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, time series data is notoriously hard to analyze,
                    and the explosive growth of the data science community has
                    led to a need for more “black-box” automated solutions that
                    can be leveraged by developers with a wide range of technical
                    backgrounds.

                    We at the Matrix Profile Foundation believe there’s an easy
                    answer. While it’s true that there’s no such thing as a
                    free lunch, the Matrix Profile (a data structure & set of
                    associated algorithms developed by the
                    <a href="https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/MatrixProfile.html" target="_blank">
                        Keogh research group
                    </a>
                    at UC-Riverside) is a powerful tool to help solve this dual
                    problem of anomaly detection and motif discovery. Matrix
                    Profile is robust, scalable, and largely parameter-free:
                    we’ve seen it work for a wide range of metrics including
                    website user data, order volume and other business-critical
                    applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we will detail below, the Matrix Profile Foundation has
                    implemented the Matrix Profile across three of the most
                    common data science languages (Python, R and Golang) as an
                    easy-to-use API that’s relevant for time series novices and
                    experts alike.
                </p>
                <h3>So what is the Matrix Profile?</h3>
                <p>
                    The basics of Matrix Profile are simple: If I take a
                    snippet of my data and slide it along the rest of the time
                    series, how well does it overlap at each new position? More
                    specifically, we can evaluate the Euclidean distance between
                    a subsequence and every possible time series segment of the
                    same length, building up what’s known as the snippet’s
                    “Distance Profile.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the subsequence repeats itself in the data, there will
                    be at least one perfect match and the minimum Euclidean
                    distance will be zero (or close to zero in the presence of
                    noise). In contrast, if the subsequence is highly unique
                    (say it contains a significant outlier), matches will be
                    poor and all overlap scores will be high. Note that the
                    type of data is irrelevant: We’re only looking at general
                    pattern conservation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then slide every possible snippet across the time series,
                    building up a collection of Distance Profiles. By taking
                    the minimum value for each time step across all distance
                    profiles, we can build the final Matrix Profile. Notice
                    that both ends of the Matrix Profile value spectrum are
                    useful. High values indicate uncommon patterns or anomalous
                    events; in contrast, low values highlight repeatable motifs
                    and provide valuable insight into your time series of interest.

                    For those interested,
                    <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-matrix-profiles-5568f3375d90" target="_blank">
                        this post by one of our co-founders
                    </a>
                    provides a more in-depth discussion of the Matrix Profile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although the Matrix Profile can be a game-changer for time
                    series analysis, leveraging it to produce insights is a
                    multi-step computational process, where each step requires
                    some level of domain experience. However, we believe that
                    the most powerful breakthroughs in data science occur when
                    the complex is made accessible. When it comes to the Matrix
                    Profile, there are three facets to accessibility:
                    “out-of-the-box” working implementations, gentle introductions
                    to core concepts that can naturally lead into deeper
                    exploration, and multi-language accessibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, we’re proud to unveil the Matrix Profile API (MPA),
                    a common codebase written in R, Python and Golang that
                    achieves all three of these goals.
                </p>
                <h3>MPA: how it works</h3>
                <p>Using the Matrix Profile consists of three steps.</p>
                <p>
                    First, you Compute the Matrix Profile itself. However, this
                    is not the end: you need to Discover something by leveraging
                    the Matrix Profile that you’ve created. Do you want to find
                    repeated patterns? Or perhaps uncover anomalous events?
                    Finally, it’s critical that you Visualize your findings, as
                    time series analysis greatly benefits from some level of
                    visual inspection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Normally, you’d need to read through pages of documentation
                    (both academic and technical) to figure out how to execute
                    each of these three steps. This may not be a challenge if
                    you’re an expert with prior knowledge of the Matrix Profile,
                    but we’ve seen that many users simply want to Analyze their
                    data by breaking through the methodology to get to a basic
                    starting point. Can the code simply leverage some reasonable
                    defaults to produce a reasonable output?
                </p>
                <p>
                    To parallel this natural computational flow, MPA consists of
                    three core components:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Compute (computing the Matrix Profile)</li>
                    <li>Discover (evaluate the MP for motifs, discords, etc)</li>
                    <li>Visualize (display results through basic plots)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    As Matrix Profile is only a few years old, we anticipate continued
                    development and plan to update this library accordingly; we gladly welcome
                    both community feedback and development assistance! We also desire to educate
                    the data science community about this technique through a growing collection
                    of Jupyter Notebook tutorials. Open-source tools form the backbone of modern analytics,
                    and we hope this implementation serves other users as effectively as it has served us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These three capabilities are wrapped up into a high-level
                    capability called Analyze. This is a user-friendly interface
                    that enables people who know nothing about the inner workings
                    of Matrix Profile to quickly leverage it for their own data.
                    And as users gain more experience and intuition with MPA,
                    they can easily dive deeper into any of the three core
                    components to make further functional gains.
                </p>
                <h3>MPA: a toy example</h3>
                <p>
                    As an example, we’ll use the
                    <a href="https://github.com/matrix-profile-foundation/matrixprofile">
                        Python flavor of MPA
                    </a>
                    to analyze the synthetic time series shown below:
                </p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/vanbenschoten/6ff01ac4b86ba7d2cd855b5ae9609e2a.js"></script>

                <p>
                    Visual inspection reveals that there are both patterns and
                    discords present. However, one immediate problem is that
                    your choice of subsequence length will change both the
                    number and location of your motifs! Are there only two
                    sinusoidal motifs present between indices 0–500, or is each
                    cycle an instance of the pattern? Let’s see how MPA handles
                    this challenge:
                </p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/vanbenschoten/10892381de4bde6eb386d878108798c7.js"></script>
                <img src="../static/img/1_nif0nUTZQtKla8dNZKYSNQ.png" alt="time series example" class="img-fluid mb-3">
                <p>
                    Because we haven’t specified any information regarding our
                    subsequence length, `analyze` begins by leveraging a powerful
                    calculation known as the pan-matrix profile (or PMP) to
                    generate insights that will help us evaluate different
                    subsequence lengths. We’ll discuss the details of PMP in a
                    later post (or you can read the associated paper), but in a
                    nutshell, it is a global calculation of all possible
                    subsequence lengths condensed into a single visual summary.
                    The X-axis is the index of the matrix profile, and the
                    Y-axis is the corresponding subsequence length. The darker
                    the shade, the lower the Euclidean distance at that point.
                    We can use the “peaks” of the triangles to find the 6 “big”
                    motifs visually present in the synthetic time series.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The PMP is all well and good, but we promised a simple way
                    of understanding your time series. To facilitate this,
                    `analyze` will combine PMP with an under the hood algorithm
                    to choose sensible motifs and discords from across all possible
                    window sizes. The additional graphs created by `analyze`
                    show the top three motifs and top three discords, along with
                    the corresponding window size and position within the Matrix
                    Profile (and, by extension, your time series).
                </p>

                    Not surprisingly, this is a lot of information coming out
                    of the default setting. Our goal is that this core function
                    call can serve as a jumping-off point for many of your future
                    analyses. For example, the PMP indicates that there is a
                    conserved motif of length ~175 within our time series. Try
                    calling `analyze` on that subsequence length and see what
