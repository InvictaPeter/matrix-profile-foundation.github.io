&lt;h3&gt;What is your personal &amp;amp; professional background?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a recovering academic: I earned my Bachelors degree in Biology from MIT, then went to the University of California - San Francisco for a Ph.D in Biophysics. I graduated in 2015, right when data science was emerging as the hot new career in Silicon Valley. Since my thesis leveraged a significant amount of computational biology it seemed like a perfect fit, and I joined the Insight Data Science Fellows program to help with my transition. From there I went to Oracle (digital advertising), Target (data measurement &amp;amp; telemetry plus lots of DevOps) and am now the Head of Data Science at Ovative Group (back to digital advertising).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How did you get connected with the Matrix Profile and MPF?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Target, Frankie and I worked on a team responsible for detecting anomalies across thousands of disparate time series, from key business metrics to server farm performance stats. This led us to discover the Matrix Profile and ultimately open-source the original matrixprofile-ts library. This then led to subsequent connections with other authors of matrix profile implementations. After a few months of working together we decided to make things more official and form a cohesive, unified group known as the Matrix Profile Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What do you do at MPF?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I play the role of CEO on our leadership board.: My primary job is to facilitate development of MPF's vision &amp;amp; direction, and then identify the right strategy to get us there. However, I'm also an organizational nerd which means I double as our unofficial Scrum Master. And I still do a little Python programming wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What excites you about the future of Matrix Profile and the MPF?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Data is only getting bigger. We're just scratching the surface of IoT and connected applications, which means that there will be a massive need for high-performing algorithms both now and in the future. I'm a little biased, but I think there's a 5% chance that Matrix Profile will be the "next big thing" in Data Science, and I'm excited to help bring that to fruition. It's also been a great experience being a part of the broader Open Source community and engaging with so many fascinating applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>meet-the-team</category><guid>https://matrixprofile.org/posts/meet-andrew-van-benschoten/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 28 Mar 2020 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Meet Frankie Cancino</title><link>https://matrixprofile.org/posts/meet-frankie-cancino/</link><dc:creator>Matrix Profile Foundation</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Frankie Cancino" src="https://matrixprofile.org/images/frankie.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is your personal &amp;amp; professional background?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did my undergrad at the University of Missouri earning a B.S. in Information Technology and Computer Science with a minor in Business. After graduating from Mizzou, I started off my professional career at Target in their Data Sciences organization then moving to an analytics team. While working at Target I began earning my M.S. from the University of Minnesota in Analytics. In addition to working at Target and earning a Master's, I founded and organize the Data Science Minneapolis Meetup group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How did you get connected with the Matrix Profile and MPF?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally found out about the Matrix Profile while working at Target and worked with Andrew to open-source the library matrixprofile-ts. Eventually, joining the Matrix Profile Foundation to oversee applied work and use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What do you do at MPF?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides some day-to-day tasks, I primarily look for partnerships and applied use cases with the matrix profile libraries being maintained by the MPF. I've also presented about using the matrix profile for various use cases across the U.S. and Canada. The others branded me as "CIO", to make me sound more official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What excites you about the future of Matrix Profile and the MPF?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What excites me most, is the potential and usefulness of this research. I'm consistently looking for ways to get a better perspective of my data. This helps me evaluate the effectiveness of models and their results across various use cases. Also, I believe the MPF can help standardize the matrix profile libraries and see to it that they reach their full potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>meet-the-team</category><guid>https://matrixprofile.org/posts/meet-frankie-cancino/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Mar 2020 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Meet Tyler Marrs</title><link>https://matrixprofile.org/posts/meet-tyler-marrs/</link><dc:creator>Matrix Profile Foundation</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tyler Marrs" src="https://matrixprofile.org/images/tyler.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is your personal &amp;amp; professional background?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started out creating websites at the young age of 12 and started working as a software engineer after earning my bachelor's degree. Falling into genomics research by accident led me down the path of obtaining a master's degree in software engineering and starting a doctoral degree in informatics. However, the doctoral degree was not for me, so I dropped the program and started working as a data scientist. My practical experience working in genomics made it a pretty smooth transition as I was already familiar with distributed algorithms, big data, and statistical programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How did you get connected with the Matrix Profile and MPF?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) conference in 2017 is where I first learned about the Matrix Profile; Eamonn Keogh and Abdullah Muenn presented. The talk seemed interesting, as the research problems I worked on were mostly time-series specific. At the time, no public repositories existed for the algorithms, so I started implementing my own with intentions on creating an open-source library. However, Andrew beat me to creating a public repository. So instead of creating a new library and competing with Andrew, I started to contribute to his repository instead. We eventually started frequently chatting online and decided to see if other matrix profile related libraries wanted to help establish the "Matrix Profile Foundation." Franz, Andrew, Austin, and I all saw great potential in this venture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What do you do at MPF?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm the primary contributor to the Python library "matrixprofile." Additionally, I oversee technical decisions. We do our best to simplify concepts and keep the library aligned with our mission statement of accessibility. If you want to give me a label, "CTO" would be the correct one to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What excites you about the future of Matrix Profile and the MPF?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of untapped potentials out there, and I feel that we are just opening the door to everyone. The biggest challenge with very dense research is making it accessible and easily understandable to everyone. I think that we have done a pretty good job at closing that gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>meet-the-team</category><guid>https://matrixprofile.org/posts/meet-tyler-marrs/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
