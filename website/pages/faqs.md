* Do you make money working on this project?
	* Nope! We are all volunteers working on a project that we are passionate about.

* I really need/want feature X. When can you implement it?
	* While we do our best to implement all desired features, we try to establish a consistent API across multiple languages making this process take some time. If you have a proposal for a specific library or language, the individuals at the Matrix Profile Foundation may review this and try to implement it into our roadmap. Any contributions may follow the Contribution Guide.

* I implemented Matrix Profile algorithms in language X. How can I join the MPF?
	* First you may understand that this is not a competition, and you must agree with the Code of Conduct. We work as a team, so you must accept that we may have some constraints regarding the API, but this will not forbid you to work in side-projects like tools, packages, products, not included in MPF API. We encourage that Matrix Profile becomes available to as many languages as possible, but always keeping a high-quality standard.

* Are you affiliated with the UCR group?
	* We are not directly affiliated with that group, however, we do have web meetings with Eamonn Keogh at times and they provide us with early research results.

* How similar is this work to stumpy?
	* It is similar with different goals in mind. We both provide matrix profile implementations to a degree. Stumpy is particular about what implementations it offers while our libraries tend to be more full-featured. We try to make the barrier to entry low. You can treat our implementations as a black box and just review the results or dig in the weeds and become a master of the algorithms. Stumpy requires some academic/technical understanding of the underlying algorithms before usage.

* Can I use the MPF API in a commercial product?
	* The API is under Apache 2.0 license. [Check here](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) what you can and what you can't do.
