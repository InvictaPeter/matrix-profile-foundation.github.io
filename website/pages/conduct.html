                The Matrix Profile Foundation (MPF) community is made up of members from around the
                globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these
                differences that our community experiences success and continued growth. We expect
                everyone in our community to follow these guidelines when interacting with others both
                inside and outside of our community. Our goal is to keep ours a positive, inclusive,
                successful, and growing community.

            <p>
                Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether on patches, reporting issues,
                asking for help or otherwise. We welcome those interested in joining the community,
                and realize that including people with a variety of opinions and backgrounds will only
                serve to enrich our community.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment
                where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference, ensuring that all
                participants are heard and feel confident that they can freely express their opinions.

            <p>
                Members of the community are considerate of their peers – other developers, users, etc.
                We are thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often
                the labor was completed simply for the good of the community. We are attentive in our
                communications, whether in person or online, and we’re tactful when approaching differing views.
            </p>
            <p>
                We recognize the work made by everyone and ensure the proper acknowledgement/citation
                of original authors at all times. As authors, we pledge to be explicit about how we
                want our own work to be cited or acknowledged.

            <p>
                Members of the community are respectful. We are respectful of others, their positions,
                their skills, their commitments, and their efforts. We are respectful of the volunteer
                and professional efforts within the community. We are respectful of the processes set
                forth in the community, and we work within them (paying particular attention to those
                new to the community).

            <p>
                We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct, and to not remain

                of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors
                that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

            <p>
                This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when
                an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing
                a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via
