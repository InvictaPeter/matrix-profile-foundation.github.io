            The Matrix Profile is a recently developed algorithm with the potential to revolutionize time-series
            analysis. To facilitate community awareness and adoption, we develop and maintain multiple
            open-source implementations of the Matrix Profile algorithms. All code is hosted on our GitHub
            repos, and additional support is provided through a dedicated
            Discord channel, e-mail correspondence and GitHub issue tracking. We strive to simplify technical
            interactions through logical, standardized APIs across all languages. We also believe that a key
            value for the Matrix Profile is continued education and expert assistance,
            particularly for non-technical audiences. We provide interactive resources and tutorials on our
            website (<a href="https://ui.matrixprofile.org">ui.matrixprofile.org</a>),
            as well as blog posts and articles containing real-world use cases.

            pioneered by <a href="https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/">Professor Eamonn Keogh</a> at the <a href="https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/">University of California-Riverside</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mueen/">Professor Abdullah Mueen</a> at the <a href="https://www.unm.edu/">University of New Mexico</a> in 2015. Ongoing research has led to
            breakthroughs in algorithm speed, robustness and use cases across industrial problems. The Matrix
