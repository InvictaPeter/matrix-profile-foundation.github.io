## What is your personal & professional background?
I was interested in computers and technology from a very young age, I started teaching myself the basic tools for web design and development in high school and took all the classes they offered on the subject. I followed this passion to college where I received a B.S. in Computer Science, as well as a B.A. in Theatre. Right after graduating in 2018 I started work as a Software Developer at CRST International, where I continue creating in house web applications and web page design specifications.

## How did you get connected with the Matrix Profile and MPF?
Well working at CRST I met Tyler Mars, who asked me if I would be willing to design a logo for an open source project he was working on at the time. After creating a logo, he asked me to make a website showcasing the people who had been working on that project, and after some time they asked me to join the team and be responsible for maintaining the design of the web site and branding materials. That open source project was MPF.

## What do you do at MPF?
I oversee the website design, logo, and brand colors. The title we landed on Chief Design Officer, which I really like, but probably means you see my name on any commits to the organization’s main libraries… for now.

## What excites you about the future of Matrix Profile and the MPF?
I am new to the matrix profile as a whole, so the thing that excites me most is learning more about it. I have been shown how useful a tool like this can be in so many different areas, and I can’t wait for it to reach its full potential.
